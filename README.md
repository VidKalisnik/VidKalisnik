<h1>Vid Kalisnik </h1>

Hi there! I'm Vid Kalisnik, a student from Slovenia studying mathematics and computer science. I'm particularly interested in AI, machine learning, and web3 technologies such as crypto and solidity.

I have experience working with a variety of programming languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, Java, C, and Solidity.

In my free time, you can find me tinkering with new technologies and working on personal projects. I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and grow as a developer, so feel free to connect with me on GitHub or check out some of my projects below.



ü§ù Collaborations welcome! Feel free to reach out if you have an interesting project in mind and think I might be able to help.

üòÑ Thanks for stopping by!
